# ðŸ“˜ Day 02 â€“ Named Entity Recognition (NER) with spaCy

On Day 2 of my 90 Days of AI journey, I explored **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** using [spaCy](https://spacy.io/), one of the most powerful and user-friendly NLP libraries in Python.

NER is a fundamental part of NLP â€” it allows us to automatically extract **real-world entities** like names of people, organizations, locations, monetary values, and more from unstructured text.

## ðŸ§  What This Notebook Covers

- Loading and using the **`en_core_web_sm`** model from spaCy
- Extracting entities from a paragraph of text
- Explaining entity labels using `spacy.explain()`
- Visualizing entities directly in Jupyter with `displacy.render()`

## ðŸš€ Sample Output

Hereâ€™s a snippet of what gets extracted:

## âœ… Why This Matters

NER is a core building block of many real-world applications:

- Chatbots and question answering systems
- Information retrieval and search
- News or document categorization
- Knowledge graph construction

This is just the beginning of the NLP journey â€” more fun coming up tomorrow! ðŸŽ¯
