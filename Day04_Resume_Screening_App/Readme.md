# 📄 Resume Screening with NLP – Day 4 of #90DaysOfAI

In today's project, I’ve built a small but meaningful tool — an NLP-based Resume Screening app that matches candidate resumes with job descriptions.

### 🧠 Problem Statement

Recruiters spend countless hours screening resumes manually. This tool helps automate the first layer of resume filtering by comparing resumes with job descriptions based on keyword similarity.

### 🔧 What it Does

- Preprocesses text from resumes and job descriptions
- Extracts meaningful keywords using NLP techniques
- Calculates similarity score between the two
- Outputs match percentage and insights

### 🚀 Technologies Used

- Python
- SpaCy / NLTK
- Sklearn (TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity)

### 📁 Files

- `resume_matcher.py` – Main script
- `data/sample_resume.txt` – Resume sample
- `data/job_description.txt` – JD sample
- `demo.ipynb` – Jupyter walk-through

### ⚡ Quick Demo


### 💭 Why this Project?

This is a real-world NLP application. It’s lightweight but scalable — and it reflects how AI can simplify tedious tasks. Plus, it’s a great addition to any AI engineer’s project portfolio.
