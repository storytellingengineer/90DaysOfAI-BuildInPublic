# ðŸ§  Day 23 â€“ Visual Dependency Parsing using spaCy

Dependency parsing is one of those NLP concepts that seems complex at firstâ€”but once you see it in action, it completely changes how you look at sentence structure!

Today, as part of my #90DaysOfAI challenge, I explored how we can use **spaCy** to break down an English sentence and visualize the grammatical relationships between words like subject, object, modifiers, etc.

---

## What I built:
- Passed a simple English sentence using **spaCy**
- Extracted each tokenâ€™s dependency role and head word (like `nsubj`, `ROOT`, `prep`)
- Visualized the **dependency tree** using **displacy**
- Wrapped it in a **Streamlit UI** for a clean and interactive experience

## Why This Matters

Dependency parsing is the foundation for tasks like:
- Question answering  
- Grammar correction  
- Machine translation  
- Text summarization

It helps us understand **who did what to whom** in a sentence â€” something even large language models rely on under the hood.

## Learnings from Day 23
Just like how NER felt like magic on Day 2, dependency parsing felt like the moment when words stopped being a lineâ€”and started becoming a tree.

Still learning, still experimenting, and excited for whatâ€™s next!
