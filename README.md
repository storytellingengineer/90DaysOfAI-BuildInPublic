# 🚀 90 Days of AI – Build In Public Challenge

Hey there! 👋
Welcome to my **90 Days of AI: Build in Public Challenge**!

I’ve been in the AI space for a while now, but this time, I want to do things differently: **stay consistent**, learn deeply, and grow in public. This repo will be my open notebook — a space where I’ll log everything I work on day by day, without over-polishing or overthinking. Over the next 90 days, I’ve decided to show up every single day and share what I’m learning, building, and struggling with in the world of AI. This challenge is inspired by the belief that learning in public not only helps you stay accountable but also creates a ripple effect of inspiration, collaboration, and growth.

Some days you’ll find small code experiments. Other days, I’ll share solutions to machine learning problems, notes on new libraries, or mini-projects in NLP or computer vision. I’ll also be solving DSA and ML algorithm problems regularly — because interviews aren’t going to crack themselves! 😄

Also — huge thanks to **Savinder Puri** for inspiring this format. His “build in public” mindset gave me the clarity to commit to this journey.

## 🎯 Purpose

As AI continues to revolutionize industries, staying consistent with hands-on practice and public sharing is essential. With this challenge, I aim to:

- Deepen my understanding of **NLP**, **Computer Vision**, and **LLMs**
- Explore **emerging Python libraries** and tools in the AI ecosystem
- Solve at least **5 DSA/ML problems** per week to strengthen fundamentals
- Document my journey daily to help others learn with me
- Improve my **GitHub and LinkedIn visibility** by contributing valuable content regularly
