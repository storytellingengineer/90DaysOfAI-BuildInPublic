# ðŸš€ 90 Days of AI â€“ Build In Public Challenge

Welcome to my **90 Days of AI: Build in Public Challenge**!

Over the next 90 days, I'm committing to **consistently learn, build, share, and grow** in the field of Artificial Intelligence. This challenge is inspired by the belief that learning in public not only helps you stay accountable but also creates a ripple effect of inspiration, collaboration, and growth.
