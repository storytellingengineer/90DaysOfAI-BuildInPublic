# 🔢 DSA & LeetCode Practice – My Learning Archive

Hey there! 👋

This folder is my personal archive where I’ll be regularly uploading my solutions to DSA problems from platforms like **LeetCode**, **GeeksforGeeks**, and other interview prep sheets.

While I'm focusing on NLP and AI as part of my 90 Days of AI challenge, I know that **strong DSA fundamentals** are crucial — especially for cracking tech interviews and boosting problem-solving skills.
