# 🔢 DSA & LeetCode Practice – My Learning Archive

Hey there! 👋

This folder is my personal archive where I’ll be regularly uploading my solutions to DSA problems from platforms like **LeetCode**, **GeeksforGeeks**, and **interview prep sheets**.

While I'm focusing on NLP and AI in my 90 Days of AI challenge, I believe **strong DSA fundamentals** are equally important — especially when preparing for tech interviews or improving problem-solving skills.

## ✍️ What You’ll Find Here

- Well-commented Python solutions for common data structures like arrays, strings, linked lists, trees, graphs, stacks, and queues.
- Problems categorized by topic and difficulty (Easy/Medium/Hard).
- Occasional notes or intuition behind the solution when the problem is tricky.
- Re-attempted problems for revision and pattern practice.

## 🔥 Goals with this folder

- Solve at least **5–7 DSA problems each week**.
- Track my progress consistently.
- Build muscle memory for common coding patterns.
