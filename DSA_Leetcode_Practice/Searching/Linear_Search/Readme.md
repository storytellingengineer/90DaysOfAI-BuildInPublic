# 🔍 Linear Search

Linear search is the simplest search algorithm. It checks every element in the array sequentially until the target element is found or the end is reached.

## 📈 Time Complexity
| Case       | Complexity |
|------------|------------|
| Best Case  | O(1)       |
| Average    | O(n)       |
| Worst Case | O(n)       |

## 💾 Space Complexity
- O(1) — Constant extra space

## ✅ When to Use
- Small or unsorted arrays
- When performance is not critical
- Data cannot be sorted easily

## 🚫 Limitations
- Not efficient for large datasets
