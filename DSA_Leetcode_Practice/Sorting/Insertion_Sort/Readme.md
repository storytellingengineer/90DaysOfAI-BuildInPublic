# Insertion Sort

## 📌 What is Insertion Sort?
Insertion Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It builds the sorted array one element at a time by inserting each element into its proper place.

## 🧠 Why It's Helpful in Interviews
- Easy to explain and implement.
- Demonstrates understanding of algorithmic thinking and nested loops.
- Often used in whiteboard interviews.
- Helps interviewers evaluate how you handle array manipulation and shifting.

## 🔍 Time Complexity
- **Best case (already sorted):** O(n)
- **Average and Worst case:** O(n²)
- **Space complexity:** O(1) – In-place sorting

## 🛠️ Use Cases
- Useful for small datasets or nearly sorted arrays.
- Preferred when memory write operations are costly (fewer writes than bubble/selection sort).
