# Insurance Claims Forecasting with Prophet

ðŸ”® **Time Series Forecasting Project** - Part of my #90DaysOfAI series (Day 16)

## Objective

Forecast future insurance claims volume using classical Time Series Forecasting techniques.

## Why this project?

As a Data Scientist in the Insurance domain, forecasting claims volume is a key task:
- Helps in capacity planning for claims processing teams
- Assists in risk modeling and reserves management
- Can improve fraud detection pipelines by providing baseline expectations

## Project Highlights

âœ… Implemented **Prophet** (by Meta) for fast and interpretable time series modeling  
âœ… Simulated 5 years of monthly insurance claims data  
âœ… Visualized:
- Forecast vs Actual Claims
- Trends in claims volume
- Yearly seasonality in claims

âœ… Evaluated model performance using:
- **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error)
- **MAPE** (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)

## Results

Prophet was able to capture seasonality and trends in the claims data effectively.  
Forecast errors (MAPE ~ x%) were within an acceptable range for planning applications.

## Next Steps

ðŸ“… Upcoming in the series:
- Day 22 â†’ Anomaly Detection in Claims Time Series  
- Day 23 â†’ Fraud Detection using Time Series Patterns  

## About

This project is part of my **#90DaysOfAI** journey.  
I'm a Data Scientist working in the Insurance Tech domain and pursuing an MTech in Applied AI.
