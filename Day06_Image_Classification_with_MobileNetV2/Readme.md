# 📸 Day 6 – Image Classification with MobileNetV2

Welcome to **Day 6** of my #90DaysOfAI challenge!

This marks the beginning of my journey into **Computer Vision** — and what better way to start than by using a powerful pre-trained model like **MobileNetV2** for image classification!

## 🔍 What I Built

I used TensorFlow’s Keras API to load the MobileNetV2 model, which has been trained on ImageNet — a massive dataset of over 1 million images.

With just a few lines of code:
- I loaded an image
- Preprocessed it to fit the model requirements
- Got the **top 3 predictions** for what the image contains
- Visualized the result using `matplotlib`
