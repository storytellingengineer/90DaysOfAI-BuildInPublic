            " So if I may be asked tell me about yourself in an interview so this would be my answer that goes that I'd be happy to that I hold a bachelor's degree in computer science and I have spent my last two years more than two years working in the insurance tech industry and as a data science I have had the opportunity to work on various projects from developing machine learning models to leading a team of developers over a couple of projects. I also got enrolled in an MTech degree program from VNIT NACOR and Applied Artificial Intelligence which gave me more insights about the field. Outside of work I'm passionate about photography, designing creative solutions and unwinding myself with music and good food.\n"
